                <p class="lead">We disclose a novel tracking method by Meta and Yandex potentially affecting
                    billions of Android users. We found that native Android apps—including <strong>Facebook,
                        Instagram</strong>, and
                    several <strong>Yandex apps including Maps and Browser—silently listen on fixed local
                        ports</strong> for tracking purposes. </p>
                <p class="lead">These native Android apps receive browsers' metadata, cookies and commands from
                    the Meta Pixel and Yandex Metrica scripts embedded on thousands of web sites. These JavaScripts load
                    on users' mobile browsers and silently connect with native apps running on the same device through
                    localhost sockets. As native apps access programatically
                    device identifiers like the <a
                        href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6048248">Android
                        Advertising ID (AAID)</a> or handle user identities as in the case
                    of Meta apps, this method effectively allows these organizations to <strong>link mobile
                        browsing sessions and web cookies to user identities</strong>, hence de-anonymizing users'
                    visiting sites embedding their scripts.</p>
                <p class="lead">This web-to-app ID sharing method bypasses typical privacy protections such as clearing
                    cookies, Incognito Mode and Android's permission controls. Worse, it opens the door for potentially
                    malicious apps eavesdropping on users’ web activity.

                    sending
                    any packets or requests to localhost. The code responsible for sending the _fbp cookie has been

                    completely removed.</div>

                    <p>
                        While there are subtle differences in the way Meta and Yandex bridge web and mobile
                        contexts and identifiers, both of them essentially misuse the unvetted access to localhost
                        sockets.
                        The Android OS allows any installed app with the INTERNET permission to open a
                        listening socket on the loopback interface (127.0.0.1). Browsers running on the same
                        device also access this interface without user consent or platform mediation. This
                        allows JavaScript embedded on web pages to communicate with native Android apps and
                        <strong>share identifiers and browsing habits</strong>, bridging ephemeral web identifiers
                        to long-lived mobile app IDs using standard Web APIs.

                            As of 25 2025, the Meta Pixel uses a technique known as
                            <a href="https://webrtchacks.com/not-a-guide-to-sdp-munging/">SDP Munging</a> to insert
                            the <strong>_fbp</strong> cookie contents to the SDP "ice-ufrag" field, resulting in a
                            Binding Request STUN message sent to the loopback address as the following figure shows.
                            This data flow cannot be observed using Chrome's regular debugging tools (such as DevTools).

                                background and creates
                                a background service to listen for incoming traffic on a TCP port (12387 or 12388)
                                and a UDP port (the first unoccupied port in 12580-12585). Users must be logged-in with
                                their credentials on the apps.

                        On or around May 17th, Meta Pixel added a new method to their script that sends the _fbp cookie
                        using <a href="https://webrtc.org/getting-started/turn-server?hl=es-419">WebRTC TURN</a> instead
                        of STUN. The new TURN method avoids SDP Munging, which Chrome developers publicly announced
                        to disable following our disclosure. As of June 2, 2025, we have not observed the Facebook
                        or Instagram applications actively listening on these new ports.

                            most common

                            A first-party cookie implies that it cannot be used to track users across websites, as it is
                            set under the website’s domain.
                            That means the same user has different _fbp cookies on different websites. However, the
                            method we disclose allows the linking of the different _fbp cookies
                            to the same user, which bypasses existing protections and runs counter to user expectations.

                            that the Yandex Metrica script transmits data via HTTPS to local ports 29010 and 30103.
                            This design choice obfuscates the data exfiltration process, thereby complicating
                            conventional detection mechanisms.

                            Yandex apps contact a Yandex domain (startup[.]mobile[.]yandex[.]net, or similar) to
                            retrieve the list of ports to listen to. The endpoint returns a JSON containing the local
                            ports (e.g., 30102, 29009) and a “first_delay_seconds” parameter which we believe is used
                            to delay the initiation of the service. On one of our test devices, first_delay_seconds
                            roughly corresponded to the number of seconds it took for the Yandex app to begin
                            listening on local ports (~3 days).

                            After receiving the localhost HTTP requests from the Yandex Metrica script, the mobile app
                            responds with a Base64-encoded binary payload embedding and bridging
                            the <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6048248">Android
                                Advertising ID (AAID)</a> along other
                            identifiers accesible from Java APIs like the Google's advertising ID
                            and UUIDs, potentially Yandex-specific. As opposed to Meta's Pixel case,
                            all this information is aggregated and uploaded together to the Yandex
                            Metrica server (e.g., mc[.]yango[.]com) by the JavaScript code running on the
                            web browser, rather than by the native app. In the case of Yandex, the
                            native app acts as a proxy to collect native Android-specific identifiers
                            and transfering them to the browser context through localhost sockets.

                            Using HTTP requests for web-to-native ID sharing (i.e. not WebRTC STUN or TURN)
                            may expose users browsing history to third-parties. A malicious third-party Android
                            application that also listens on the aforementioned ports can intercept the HTTP requests
                            sent by the Yandex Metrica script and the first, now-unused, implementation of Meta’s
                            communication

                        <p>We developed a proof-of-concept app to

                            app. We found that browsers such as Chrome,
                            Firefox and Edge are susceptible to this form of <strong>browsing history leakage in both
                                default and private browsing modes</strong>. Brave browser was
                            unaffected
                            by this issue due to their blocklist and the blocking of requests to the
                            localhost; and DuckDuckGo was only minimally affected due to missing domains in
                            their blocklist.

                            purpose
                            is to assess the prevalence of these behaviors in a representative sample of web
                            sites.</strong>
                        Therefore, the absence of a website in this list does not necessarily imply that it does not
                        integrate
                        these tracking capabilities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Crawling methodology:</strong>
                        When visiting the site, our crawler waits for the page to load, after which it accepts
                        all cookies on the site (if any). It then waits a further ten seconds, while collecting
                        all HTTP requests, WebSocket frames and WebRTC function calls made during the visit.
                        Analyzing this data, we found Meta’s pixel sending to localhost on 15,677 sites
                        accessed from the EU and 17,223 sites accessed from the US. Yandex metrica was found on
                        1,260 and 1,312 sites accessed from the EU and US, respectively.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To assess whether these tracking practices occur without potential user consent,
                        we performed a second crawling campaign without interacting with the
                        cookie consent window (if any is prsented to the user).
                        Even without actively giving consent to these sites (i.e., not accepting any cookies or no
                        consent
                        window),
                        the Meta Pixel sends the fbp cookie to localhost
                        on 11,890 and 13,468 sites accessed from the EU and US potentially without consent,
                        respectively. In the case of Yandex, it triggers the localhost requests
                        on 1,064 and 1,095 sites in the EU and US potentially without consent,
                        respectively.

                        This novel tracking method exploits unrestricted access to localhost sockets on the
                        Android platforms, including most Android browsers. As we show, these trackers perform
                        this practice without user
                        awareness, as current privacy controls (e.g., sandboxing approaches,
                        mobile platform and browser permissions,
                        web consent models, incognito modes, <a

                        are insufficient to control and mitigate it.

                    <p>
                        We note that localhost communications may be used for legitimate purposes such as
                        web development. However, the
                        research community has raised
                        <a href="https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ndss2019_06B-5_Wu_paper.pdf">
                            concerns</a> about localhost sockets becoming
                        a potential vector for data leakage and persistent tracking. To the best of our
                        knowledge, however, no evidence of real-world abuse for persistent user tracking
                        across platforms has been reported until our disclosure.

                    Our responsible disclosure to major Android browser vendors led to several patches
                    attempting to mitigate this issue; some already deployed,
                    others currently in development. We thank all participating vendors (Chrome, Mozilla, DuckDuckGo,
                    and Brave) for their active collaboration and constructive engagement throughout the process.
                    Other Chromium-based browsers should follow upstream code changes to patch their own products.
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, beyond these short-term fixes, fully addressing the issue will require a broader set of
                    measures as they are not covering the fundamental limitations of platforms' sandboxing
                    methods and policies. These include user-facing controls to alert users about localhost access,
                    stronger platform policies accompanied by consistent and strict enforcement actions
                    to proactively prevent misuse, and enhanced security around
                    Android’s interprocess communication (IPC) mechanisms, particularly those relying on localhost
                    connections.

                        This tracking method defeats Android's inter-process isolation and tracking protections
                        based on partitioning, sandboxing, or clearing client-side state.

                        Preliminary results suggest that these practices may be implemented
                        in websites without explicit and appropriate cookie consent forms. If a site loads the
                        Facebook or Yandex scripts before a user has given consent to the appropriate cookies,
                        this behaviour will still be triggered.

                    <p><b>Q: Why did Facebook stop using this technique on the day of your public release?</b></p>
                    <p><b>A:</b> We don’t know ¯\_(ツ)_/¯, but we're happy to see that Android users
                        are no longer affected by this type abuse after our disclosure (for now).</p>

                    <p><b>Q: Is this research peer-reviewed?</b></p>
                    <p><b>A:</b> Our findings were confirmed by certain parties that we disclosed to, but the study
                        isn’t peer-reviewed yet. We chose not to delay public disclosure for the publication cycle due
                        to the severity of the active abuse.</p>

                    <p><b>Q: Did Meta or Yandex disclose this method in their documentation?</b></p>
                    <p><b>A:</b> We found no public technical documentation from Meta or Yandex describing this specific
                        localhost-based communication technique. In developer forums, some developers have raised
                        concerns about Pixel scripts contacting localhost, but received no detailed explanation.</p>

                    <p><b>Q: Does this only affect Android users? What about iOS or other platforms?</b></p>
                    <p><b>A:</b> We have only obtained empirical evidence of this web-to-native ID bridging
                        Meta and Yandex web scripts, which exclusively targeted mobile Android users.
                        No evidence of abuse has been observed in iOS browsers and apps that we tested. That said,
                        similar
                        data sharing between iOS browsers and native apps is <i>technically</i> possible.
                        iOS browsers, which are all based on WebKit,
                        <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=279249"> allow developers to
                            programmatically establish localhost connections</a> and apps can listen on
                        local ports.
                        It is possible that technical and policy restrictions for running <a
                            href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/configuring-background-execution-modes">native
                            apps in the background</a> may explain why iOS users were not targeted by these trackers.
                        We note, however, that our iOS analysis is still preliminary and this behavior might have also
                        violated PlayStore policies. Beyond mobile platforms,
                        web-to-native ID bridging could also <a
                            href="https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~frankli/papers/li-imc2021-weblocal.pdf">
                            pose a threat</a> on desktop OSes and smart TV platforms, but
                        we have not yet investigated these platforms.
